# Pears-Orchard 

PeARS (version Orchard) is a search engine that you can install and run locally from your browser. 
It allows you to 'index' pages (i.e. to produce a computer-readable representation of the pages' content, essential to the search process), and to search pages that you or your friends have indexed. 
Search happens entirely on your machine, meaning that no one knows what you are searching and when.
